## Django Task Wodasoft by - Mitanshu Holkar

This is the repository that I made for the task assigned to me by Wodasoft. In this task, I have used django i18n support to translate the content into desired languages. I have made my personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, JS, bootstrap and I have used django as a backend framework to connect the UI with the database. I have used two languages here for the translation - English and French.

I have attached the screenshots of the Portfolio Website, You can see the changes in the language by selecting desired language - English or French.
